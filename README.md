# Computational-Intelligence
All material in this repository is made public to be evaluated by other colleagues, for peer-review, to contain homeworks, final project, and to take the final exam of the Computational Intelligence @PoliTo course.

## Labs
- Lab 01 (in the `set-covering` directory): Implement $A^*$ for the Set Covering Problem. The solution can be found in the _Lab 01_ section of the Notebook.

- Lab 02 (in the `lab2` directory): Implement a **Rule-based agent** and an **Evolved agent** using an _ES_ strategy to play the Nim game. The solution can be found in the Notebook inside the directory.

- Lab 03 (in the `lab9` directory): Solve the *Black-box Problem* instances 1, 2, 5, and 10 on a 1000-loci genomes, using a minimum number of fitness calls. The solution can be found in the Notebook inside the directory.

- Lab 04 (in the `lab10` directory): Use **reinforcement learning** to devise a *Tic-Tac-Toe player*. The solution can be found in the Notebook inside the directory.

## Project - Quixo

For the final project, I collaborated with [Davide Vitabile s330509](https://github.com/Vitabile/Computational-Intelligence). The project can be found at [Computational-Intelligence-Project](https://github.com/FarInHeight/Computational-Intelligence-Project).
