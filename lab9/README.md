# Black Box Problem

Given a black-box fitness function, our goal is to solve problem instances 1, 2, 5 and 10 with the minimum number of fitness calls. \
We are allowed to implement any algorithm we can think of, no rules.

## Proposed solutions
The proposed solutions are based on genetic algorithms with diversity promotion.

## Collaborations
To implement instances 1 and 2, I collaborated with [Davide Vitabile s330509](https://github.com/Vitabile/Computational-Intelligence/tree/main), [Alexandro Buffa s316999](https://github.com/ExalFabu/Computational-Intelligence/tree/main), [Simone Giambrone s317002](https://github.com/JustLooller/Computational-Intelligence/tree/main) and [Andrea Panuccio s294603](https://github.com/AndPan96/Computational-Intelligence/tree/main).
For instances 5 and 10, the proposed results were developed by [Davide Vitabile s330509](https://github.com/Vitabile/Computational-Intelligence/tree/main) and myself.
