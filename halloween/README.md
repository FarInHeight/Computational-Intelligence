# Halloween Challenge

Given the **Set Covering Problem**, find the best solution using *Single-state methods* with the fewest calls to the fitness functions for:

* `num_points = [100, 1_000, 5_000]`
* `num_sets = num_points`
* `density = [.3, .7]` 

## Answer

The Halloween challenge has been accepted. To solve it, I'd reply with the following methods (with some modifications described for each algorithm, if any):
- **Random-Mutation Hill Climber**;
- **Steepest-Step Hill Climber**;
- **Steepest-Step Hill Climber with Replacement**;
- **Tabu Search**;
- **Simulated Annealing**.
